# Routing-Program
This is a route finding application related to the Traveling Salesman Problem.

I apologize for the .zip but apparently this file is too large for Github. Here is a section from a write up related to this program about what I would do
if I was going to approach this problem again.
"
If I were to approach this project from the beginning I would make a few changes.
I would change the way the packages are loaded on each truck. Currently they were
manually loaded by me so that I could be sure that all the requirements would be met
when the route was found. I would also change the algorithm so that the first item in the
list was not always the first item delivered. This could allow for a shorter route if the first
item was a long distance from the hub. I may also allow the algorithm to check different
combinations of packages on each truck as long as all the packages with deadlines
would be delivered on time. This would also give me an opportunity for a shorter route. I
would also make an effort to balance the load of each truck so they were as similar as
allowed. Another part of the program that could use extra attention would be input-error
checking. If this program was to be distributed and used more than currently it would be
frustrating to re-run the script in the current state.
